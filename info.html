<h1>Similarity index between projects</h1>
<br>
<h3> The similarity index shows the ratio of the shared vs the total value tags of the compared projects </h3>
<br>
<p> The index shown in the "project - similarity" column of the table relies on the tags related to each project and based on the Jaccard coeficcient </p>
<p> The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between finite sample sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index">Jaccard Index (Wikipedia)</a>
<p> The sample sets are the sets of tags linked to the projects </p>
<p> The second column "tags" lists all the tags that are in common (intersection of the sets) between the two projects - the selected one and the one in the left column of the table </p>
<br>
<br>
<p> For example, the project ADVANCE has 3 tags:
<ul> Vaccines </ul>
<ul> Infectious diseases </ul>
<ul> Methods for benefit/risk assessment </ul>
</p>
<p> the project ZAPI has 2 tags:
<ul> Vaccines </ul>
<ul> Infectious diseases </ul>
</p>
<p> in total there are 3 different tags and two of them are shared between both projects </p>
<p> this gives a jaccard coeficcient of 2/3, rounded 67%
<P> the similarity index between both projects is 67%
